# Webtest: 0

# Goal

Before to start I need to have very clear what is my goal. At least, my most immediate one. In this case it will be to be able to start to work and test my ideas.

So the first thing is to install the needed tools:

* Test-Kitchen
* Vagrant
* ServerSpec

I have already installed **Vagrant** and I use it with **LXC** (thanks to the great *Fabio Rehm*'s plugin [vagrant-lxc][1]) because it's much much faster than *VirtualBox*, so I skipped that part.

As my very first goal is to have the minimal tooling ready to try something, I'd say that my **DoD** (*Definition of Done*) here is that I'm able to test the simplest cookbook possible with Test-kitchen:
> cookbook with an **empty recipe** and the **basic metadata file**.

This is how the minimal skeleton would look like:

```
webtest-0/
├── Gemfile
├── .kitchen.yml
├── metadata.rb
├── README.md
└── recipes
    └── default.rb

```

## Test that everything is in place

The content of the files are pretty simple and easy to understand so I won't explain them.

To install the tools, dependencies and check that everything is in order I'll run this:
```
$ bundle
... (here goes the bundle output)
$ bundle exec kitchen converge
```

After that, `kitchen` will set up a virtual machine with Vagrant and LXC and run chef-solo with my empty recipe. And the output will be something like this:
```

```

Ok, everything is in place and working. Time to write some tests :-)

I'll keep going at the [webtest-1][2] step.
